'''
Exercise 1   Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see
what they do:
'''

5
x = 5
x + 1

'''
The results are different if you put these statements into a script or run 
them in an interpreter. In a script they are loaded into memory then never
used seemingly doing nothing. If they are placed into an interpreter there is
some response from the interpreter (ipython):

In [2]: 5
Out[2]: 5

In [3]: x = 5

In [4]: x + 1
Out[4]: 6
