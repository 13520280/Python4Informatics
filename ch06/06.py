'''
Read the documentation of the string methods at
docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html. You might want to experiment with
some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are
particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in
find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub
is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is
optional.
